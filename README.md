## Introduction

While the original Robert C. Martin's book [_Clean Code_][3] represents a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable code, this document will also describe the principles of creating compatible applications for the [Enonic][1] [XP][2]. Some parts of this document can be used as a style guide since it touches not only the TypeScript, but also a CSS, application structure, and even Git commits.

It's recommended to read the following first:

* [Clean Code][3] by Robert C. Martin;
* [Clean Code JavaScript][4] adaptation by [Ryan McDermott][5];
* [Clean Code TypeScript][6] adaptation by [Labs42][7].
